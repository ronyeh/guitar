# Guitar + JavaScript

This tutorial demonstrates shows how to create a basic guitar in JavaScript. All code on this page is MIT licensed. The source code [can be found here](https://github.com/ronyeh/piano/tree/main). The source code for this website [can be found here](https://github.com/ronyeh/piano/tree/gh-pages).

## Audio

First, we will need to play individual notes from our virtual guitar. We can use a JS library for this. Here are two that are easy to use:
* Musical
* Tone

Synthesizing a guitar string is an advanced topic for another day. For now, we will use audio sampled from a real guitar.

```js
alert('Hello World');
```

## Graphics

Let's make some graphics for our guitar. We will use SVG.

```js
alert('Hello World');
```

## Interaction

Now we need to let the user interact with the guitar, through the mouse and keyboard (or through tapping and swiping on a touch screen).

```js
alert('Hello World');
```
